    <p>Hi! My name is Aaron.  I grew up in Washington State and currently live in Seattle.  I have lived here my whole life except for college which I spent in St. Louis Missouri.  After college, I worked for 6 years as a mechanical engineer before moving into project management.  Now, I am learning how to code so I can build awesome software!  I just got married this year and I live with my wife, our cat Izzy, and our dog Sophie.  Thanks for taking my guessing game quiz!</p>
